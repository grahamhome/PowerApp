This is the directory for plot generation functions.
Each R file in this directory must contain a function that
shares its name with the file itself plus _names (i.e. "map_names()") that returns a list with the proper name of the plot and all of the functions in the file that return a plot object.
The thumbnails folder contains a png of a sample plot for each type, to be displayed by the UI.
