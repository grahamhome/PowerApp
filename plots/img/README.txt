This directory contains folders and images generated by PowerViewer in order to display animations.
If a plotting function is re-written, it will not overwrite the existing images - they must be deleted
manually from the folder with the name of the rewritten function. This is a feature, not a bug, as
the point of this directory is to cache images so they will not have to be created more than once.
