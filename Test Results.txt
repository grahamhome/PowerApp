Test: Write 30 images to disk.

Results (Windows, 4 cores):
Basic sequential method: 8.32622228463491 minutes
Sequential method with PNG device: 2.88573749860128 minutes
Basic parallel method: 4.73992403348287 minutes
Parallel method with PNG device: 1.73995466629664 minutes
Parallel method with PNG device and dependency pre-loading: 1.55165638128916

Conclusion: Parallel method is fastest, but not too much faster than simply using the PNG device.

Run 1:
Basic sequential method: 5.78623918294907 mins
Sequential method with built-in PNG device: 1.96626414855321 mins
Sequential method with proxy PNG device: 1.91364219983419 mins
Conclusion: I can use the proxy PNG device instead of rewriting all the plotting plugins.
